# How to run the code on your PC

- Install node from https://nodejs.org/en if not already installed
- Execute the following in cmd (in the file-reader directory):
* npm install (this will install all dependencies and create a folder called node_modules)
* npm start (this will create a server on your computer, and the file will not run unless the server is running, so don't close the terminal) .
